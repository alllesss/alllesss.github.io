# Video Recap
To recap my 2024's progress with ESHRAQ, I thought it's best to do it in a video format and just walk through different updates, big and small and load up a few models to demonstrate them. it ended up a bit longer than I expected but I just can't be bothered to shorten it, So here you go, a chunky 50 minutes devlog!

Note: if your internet speed allows it, I'd recommend watching it on `2160p-60FPS` for visual experience.
