I’m excited to share the initial phase of my new project, titled "**ESHRAQ**" <span class="farsi"><strong>(اشراق)</strong></span>, meaning illumination. The name "ESHRAQ" is inspired by the Persian philosopher `Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi` (b. 1154) and his masterpiece, "Hikmat al Eshraq" (The Philosophy of Illumination). Suhrawardi's work explores fascinating concepts of light, essence, existence, and the divine. This project is not a direct simulation of Suhrawardi's ideas but rather an experiment with his philosophical insights within a contemporary computational framework. By partially emulating and synthesizing Suhrawardi's core concepts, I aim to explore their relevance and potential in today's context.  

Over the past year, I've been focusing on learning `C++` to sharpen my coding skills, which became essential for exploring modularity's true potential. At the same time, I engaged in philosophical readings through the `Foreign Object` online study group, profoundly influenced by Reza Negarestani's guidance. These studies were crucial for understanding how computation and models can be used as tools for deeper inquiries into the complex and entangled concepts of the real world.

In this project, computation is not merely about 0s and 1s, CPUs, and hardware but about a cognitive system where instructions, observations, and engagements with models can occur. This is why I envision this work as a dynamic process leading to unexpected outcomes.

The emphasis is on exploring models emanated by the light of mechanisms, functions, and codes. Here, modularity plays an important role, not only for a more intuitive understanding of these models but also for allowing flexibility in rapidly iterating ideas, reducing the cost of implementation.

This interactive simulation serves as a foundation, hosting ideas and generating outcomes much like an open notebook. Each note is a model made from different modules, behaving through various mechanisms. These notes can be played with in a simulation, read through blog posts, or who knows where they might end up!

I’ve created a short walkthrough video showcasing the early phase of this work. After watching it, I'll dive deeper into Suhrawardi’s philosophy and its impact on my project.
