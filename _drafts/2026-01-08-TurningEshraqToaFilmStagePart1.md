# Turning ESHRAQ into a Film Stage  
*Cinema, Simulation, and Ontology*

It’s been a while since my last post here.

In the second half of 2025, I had the opportunity to show my work at **Emerging Exits** in Arnhem (1 October till 3 November). For this exhibition, I decided to prepare a cinematic experience sourced entirely from ESHRAQ’s simulated environment. It felt like the right moment to turn ESHRAQ into a **film stage**.

<ESHRAQ Documentation Bunker here>

I had been carrying a few ideas for a script for some time. They were slowly simmering in the background but never fully surfaced, until the twelve-day war happened in Iran. Following the horror unfolding back home from the relative safety of Amsterdam was deeply unsettling. At the same time, it forced something into focus. Within a week after the war ended, I managed to write the first draft of the film script.

When I say *film*, I mean **two story loops**. Both are based on ESHRAQ, but they unfold in completely different models. One takes place in the **Ziggurat of Ur**, the other in a **modular version of Amsterdam**.  
This post focuses on the first loop, and on what it meant to turn a simulation into cinema.

## Why Cinema, Why Now

One of my main motivations for working cinematically with a simulation is that cinema remains a very potent medium for unraveling complex webs of knowledge and information in a tangible way.

I can talk or write about ESHRAQ’s ontology for hours and still miss essential aspects of it. But within a twenty-minute film, this world and its internal logic begin to illuminate themselves. The ontology becomes visible through **movement**, **rhythm**, **sound**, **scale**, and **duration**. To me, this feels like a very efficient form of compression, one that cinematic language uniquely allows.

Throughout the film, this ontology of light becomes the ground on which new stories can exist. These stories unfold as **loops**. You can call them *story loops* if you will. They allow complex expressions to emerge from a relatively simple and grounded simulation.

## Writing the Film and Writing With the Simulation

I wrote the draft script in **Scrivener**, which I would recommend for scriptwriting and long-form thinking in general.

From there, I moved into production in **Unreal Engine**. I had roughly two and a half months to turn the script into a twenty-minute film. Thanks to the foundational work that had already been done in ESHRAQ, much of the process was accelerated.

The **modular structure** helped enormously. The Ziggurat of Ur already existed as a modular system and only needed specific modifications. The same applied to agents, environments, and architectural logic.

## Cinematic Language and Format

I chose a **2.55 wide aspect ratio**, with a final output resolution of `4096 × 1716`. This very wide format, combined with emulated **Panavision C-Series anamorphic lenses**, creates an immersive frame that wraps around the viewer’s vision.

In post-production, I leaned into virtual production techniques such as **lens distortion**, **film grain**, **color work**, **flares**, and **bloom**, aiming to get as close as possible to the texture of real cinema lenses.

This choice was also influenced by how much I admired the image quality of *Star Wars: Andor*, as well as *Dune: Part One*. There is something about that visual language that holds science fiction and gravity at the same time.

## When Cinema Rewrites Ontology

Something unexpected happened while writing cinematically. Ideas emerged that had never appeared during the simulation phase. Switching into a storytelling mindset changed how the world itself wanted to express things.

In that sense, the film did not simply visualize ESHRAQ. It actively generated **new ontological ground** for it. Narrative pressure, pacing, framing, and duration reshaped how the simulation behaved and what it could express. Expanding the film will continue to influence how ESHRAQ’s ontology evolves.

## The Opening: Birds, Annihilation, Becoming

The first eight minutes of the film function as an introduction to ESHRAQ’s illuminationist foundation.

Thirty birds appear on screen, all constructed from modules. Each has the head of a **Huma bird**, but in different states of decay. They initially exist in a divine realm, receive a calling, and are then deployed into the desert of ESHRAQ.

For Iranian viewers, this references *The Conference of the Birds* by Attar. In that poem, a group of birds sets out on a journey to find truth, only to realize that they themselves are what they were searching for.

In Sufi terminology, this journey involves **fanā’**, the annihilation of the self, followed by **baqā’**, remaining or becoming.

In the film, I invert this logic. The thirty birds begin as a whole and are then fragmented and dispersed back into the desert. This individuation is justified by history. We know where they came from.

In ESHRAQ, all thirty birds are in fact **one bird**, the Huma, encountered across different temporalities. Unlike Attar’s birds, which come from different species, these are the same mythic entity fractured across time. The plurality does not come from identity, but from accumulated meaning and historical interpretation.

## Light, Bombs, Modules

The birds pass through a very bright rectangular window of light and enter the desert. They drop rocket-like bombs that open mid-air before touching the ground. Each bomb releases an **orb of light**, which falls, densifies, and gradually turns into an architectural module such as a wall, stair, or floor. The empty shell then returns to the sky.

This repeats in time-lapse until the entire Ziggurat is constructed in a dense cascade of light.

Agents arrive differently. They appear as raging, luminous red spheres that spiral violently into the ground.

This opening sequence establishes the internal logic of the world so that everything that follows can operate through it.

## Souls and the Ziggurat Loop

Within the film, the Ziggurat becomes a deep object where the first story loop unfolds. The soul of **Mythic George Bush** is spawned into the site.

I spent a long time thinking about the design of souls in ESHRAQ and how they could be materialized. I eventually arrived at the idea of representing them as **luminous red-orange spheres**, almost like miniature stars hovering above specific sites.

Each soul connects through a visible line or cable to an idle agent on the ground. When the soul becomes active, it forms a bond with the agent. In the film, the camera follows this connection as Mythic George Bush begins to speak about unfinished business.

Mythic George Bush, or `MGB`, is an amalgamation of George Bush and his father. I wanted to test the boundaries of what a soul could be. Can it be composite? Can it be an infusion of multiple figures? What other chemistries might be possible?

Through MGB, the history of the Ziggurat is retold from multiple vantage points. Ancient cosmology sits next to the Gulf War and the US invasion of Iraq. This section was sparked by a photograph of American soldiers ascending the Ziggurat. The contradictions in that image became a driving force behind this loop.

## Soul View and the Imaginal

Another important design element is what I call the **Soul View**, developed together with Danial Alemasoum. We wanted a visual language rooted in ESHRAQ’s modular logic while drawing from Iranian material culture.

We were inspired by glass and mirror architecture, especially the **Shrine of Imam Reza** in Mashhad. As a child, I used to stare at mirrored ceilings and try to find myself within the reflections. The architecture never allowed it.

This experience shaped the Soul View. It produces fragile, mirage-like images that appear and disappear. It reveals information about souls that cannot be materialized on the ground.

There is also a reference to sand as the source of glass. The film begins in a desert, which I see as a strong metaphor for the **imaginal world**. A place where things dissolve, but also where sand and light conspire to form endless images.

## Writing With Simulation

Although I wrote a script, many scenes emerged directly from play. While navigating ESHRAQ as a simulation, I encountered moments that felt too strong to ignore. These moments were logged back into the script.

The writing process became both **top-down** and **bottom-up**.

Simulation also transformed cinematography. Being able to inhabit the film stage freely and repeatedly allowed me to survey locations for camera movement and framing before committing to shots. Using Unreal’s `Cine Camera Actor` enabled movements that would be impossible or dangerous in real-world filming.
It's good to know that even for the pre-production of Dune Part 2 they used Unreal Engine to plan their shots in the desert that was simulated in unreal. https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/unreal-engine-streamlines-desert-production-on-dune-part-two


I also chose to keep glitches and artifacts that emerged naturally. Collision errors and clipping are not mistakes to hide. They are part of the living conditions of a computational world.

---

## Physical Dimension

For Emerging Exits, I introduced a physical element sourced from ESHRAQ. I created a lightbox containing the thirty Huma heads, aligned as if passing through the threshold of light again, but without wings.

Encountered without mediation, these objects invite interpretation. After watching the film, they acquire new meaning. The tension between these readings is something I want to preserve.

---

## Closing

Showing this twenty-minute section of ESHRAQ confirmed something important for me. **Cinema is not a secondary output of the simulation.** It is a generative force that reshapes its ontology.

This film is not a conclusion.  
It is a threshold.

*Next post: the second story loop, set in a modular Amsterdam.*
