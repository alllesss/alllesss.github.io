# The Second Loop: Amsterdam, Museums, and Lost Agency

Alongside the Ziggurat loop, the film unfolds a second story loop set in a **modular version of Amsterdam**. This loop shifts ESHRAQ outward, into institutional space, lived architecture, and questions of agency.

## Building a Modular Amsterdam

The second loop follows the soul of **Liz Hoekstra**, an assistant curator in a fictional museum.

The architecture of the city is heavily informed by my lived experience of Amsterdam. Having lived here since 2018, it has become my home. For this model, I created sampled materials based on the city’s most common architectural elements. Red brick walls, bike lane asphalt, grass modules, and more.

My initial idea was to build only a museum, but this gradually expanded into a city-scale model.

The city developed a clear division between residential and commercial areas. The residential zones became chaotic, with modules placed irregularly. This began as an accident but slowly started to feel appropriate, reflecting the precarious housing situation in Amsterdam.

## The Museum as a Ritual Space

The idea of building a museum was sparked by a visit to the **Stedelijk Museum** in early summer of 2025. During that visit, I encountered two works that stayed with me for very different reasons.

The first was Pamela Rosenkranz’s exhibition *Liquid Body*. I can be cynical at times, but this exhibition left me feeling empty. It reinforced my disillusionment with parts of the art world that rely on high production value and grand gestures while remaining conceptually hollow.

To me, it appeared to critique capitalism while fully participating in it. Overproduced, polished, and strangely void.

In the film, this becomes a fictional work where one of the assistant curator’s tasks is to fill empty **Amazon boxes** with cash sourced from the museum’s basement. I imagined the institution desperately feeding its own money into the work to sustain its cultural and financial value.

## Transparency as Performance

The second trigger was encountering Ahmet Öğüt’s *Barricade* in the collection. Next to the work were framed correspondences between the museum and the artist regarding a request to loan the piece to student protests in solidarity with Palestine. The museum politely rejected the request, citing contractual obligations.

What struck me was not the refusal itself, but the framing of the refusal. Displaying the letters as a gesture of transparency felt deeply odd. It suggested that by showing its own inaction, the institution retained an image of moral clarity.

Doing nothing became aestheticized.

This is something I have observed repeatedly after living in the Netherlands for many years. A pattern where institutions maintain ethical posture through procedural correctness, while avoiding action.

This does not mean I see everything as black and white. I have experienced many powerful exhibitions in that museum as well. But those successes are celebrated loudly, while moments of complicity often remain unexamined.

---

## Still Life and the Aesthetics of Inaction

In response, I introduced another layer in the film. A fictional exhibition titled **Still Life**, commissioned to a fictional Austrian artist, *Clara Gruber Hoffman*.

The work references Dutchbat and Dutch complicity in the Serbian genocide. In the film, doing nothing becomes an aesthetic gesture.

This lack of agency becomes especially charged within ESHRAQ. The UN soldiers are shown sitting on red orbs. These orbs are agents that have lost their agency. `570` of them.

The museum becomes a place where agency is suspended, ritualized, and displayed.

## Closing

The Amsterdam loop is not a critique from the outside. It is a simulation of how institutions continue to function while doing nothing.

In ESHRAQ, agency is never assumed. It can be removed, aestheticized, or quietly absorbed into routine.

This second loop does not resolve anything.  
It leaves the question open.
